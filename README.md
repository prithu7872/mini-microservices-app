# mini-microservices-app

We're building a simple application for creating and commenting on posts. Users will see a form to create posts with only a title. 
After submitting, the post title, comment count, and a comment form will be displayed. 
Users can add comments which increment the comment count and are displayed below the post title. 
Multiple posts can be created and commented on.

## Despite its simplicity, this application is surprisingly complex.
